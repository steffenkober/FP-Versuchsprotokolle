After the setup was adjusted the first measurement is taken. The data shown in plot \ref{fig:no_purge}. 



The maxium of the plot lies at around $\qty{153645}{a.u.}$ of electric field amplitude.

Here will come some words as an introduction. maybe about the amplitude of the null measurement so that the basis of the measurement is clear.

\section{Air Humidity in the Laboratory}
\label{sec:water_abso}
To extract frequency information a fast fourier transformation (FFT) of the data is performed. The frequency domain is represented in figure \ref{fig:freq_no_purge}.
