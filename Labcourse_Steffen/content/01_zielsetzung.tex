\chapter{Goal}
\label{cha:goal}
The goal of this lab-course is to acquire knowlege about terahertz spectroscopy and its aplications. This protocoll will treat fundamental physical properties of matter, such as 
the refractive index, conductivity and resistivity. Also this protocoll treats 2D-pump-and-probe spectroscopy and non-linear processes of matter.
