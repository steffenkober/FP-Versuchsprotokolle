In this experiment, the mean lifetime of cosmic muons arising in the atmosphere at an altitude of $\approx \qty{10}{\kilo\meter}$ from particle showers
is to be measured and evaluated. Further it is required to understand the detection method of muons. For this the interaction and function of each componant inside the detector
has to be understood. This experiment should lead to an fundamental understanding of NIM-standard circuits.
