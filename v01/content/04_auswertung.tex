\chapter{Data Analysis}
\label{cha:Auswertung}
The data was measuered with the setup discussed in the chapters \ref{cha:Theorie} and \ref{cha:Durchf√ºhrung}. The duration of the data collection was $T_\mathrm{Dur} = \qty{70.26}{\hour}$. In this 
time $N_{\mathrm{start}} = \num{3427476}$ start signals and $N_{\mathrm{stop}} = \num{1818}$ stop signals were detected by the setup. The search time was set to 
$T_\mathrm{search} = \qty{10}{\micro\second}$.

\section{Estimation of a Constant Background Detection}
\label{sec:background}
A constant background rate in the counting is expected in this experiment. Before conducting the measurement this background rate can be estimated to later evaluate the experimentally 
determined background rate. To estimate the background rate in this experiment the mean amount of muons in the detector has to be calculated. It is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:muon_amount}
    \nu = \frac{N_\mathrm{start}}{T_\mathrm{Dur}} = \qty{13.55}{\per\second} .
\end{equation}
Since this is a counting experiment the counts should be possion distributed and the probability, that $k$ muons hit the detector while it is measering is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:prob}
    P_{T_\mathrm{search}\nu}(k) = \frac{(T_\mathrm{search}\nu)^k}{k!}\mathrm{e}^{T_\mathrm{search}\nu} .
\end{equation}

The function \ref{eqn:prob} is proportional to the factorial of $k$, so every order above $k=1$ is negligible. The propability of one additional muon entering the chamber in the 
search time is 
\begin{equation*}
    P_{T_\mathrm{search}\nu}(k=1) = \qty{0.013}{\percent} .
\end{equation*}

From this the estimation of the background rate $U_0$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:background}
    U_0 = \frac{N_\mathrm{start}P_{T_\mathrm{search}\nu}(k=1)}{N_\mathrm{channel}} = \qty{1.08}{counts\per channel} .
\end{equation}

In this equation $N_\mathrm{channel} = 430$ is the amount of channels.

\section{Determination of the Resolution Time}
\label{sec:resoltion time}
The resolution time is an important quantity of the setup. It characterizes the minimal temproal distance to distinguish to possible signals.% oder?
To determine the resolution time of the setup a delay time $T_\mathrm{Delay}$ is introduced to the two different photomultipliers. This is necessary to phase the photomultipliers,
since signals are only counted when both multipliers give a signal. As a counting experiment the data should comply with the possion distribution. Hence, the errors are given 
by $\sqrt{N}$. The measerd counts dependend on the delay time are shown in table \ref{tab:t_d}. In this table a negative delay time corresponds to one photomultiplier and a positive 
delay time to the second one.

\end{figure}

The data is also shown in figure \ref{fig:t_d}. In this figure the course of the data shows a plateau from $\qty{-1}{\nano\second}$ to $\qty{5}{\nano\second}$ at around $\qty{7.2}{\per\second}$.
The resolution time corresponds to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the data. As shown in figure \ref{fig:t_d} the resolution time for this setup is $\qty{12}{\nano\second}$.

\section{Calibration of the Multichannel Analyser}
\label{sec:MCA}

As discussed earlier the TAC converts the temporal distance of the signals into an amplitude. The multichannel analyser (MCA) converts this amplitude into counts amoung different 
channels. The number of the categorized channel has a correlation to the measured lifetime of the muons. This correlation has to be determined before the measurement. The measured 
data of the time dependece of the MCA is given in table \ref{tab:MCA}. For better visualization the data is plotted in figure \ref{fig:MCA}.

      \midrule

    \caption{Linear regression\cite{scipy} of the data to obtain a functional correlation between the channel number and the lifetime.}
    \label{fig:MCA}
\end{figure}

A linear regression of the data is used to calculate parameters, which determine the functional correlation \ref{eqn:MCA} between the channel number $K$ and the time $t$.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:MCA}
    t[\unit{\micro\second}] = 0.021739K +  0.15217
\end{equation}

\section{Lifetime of Cosmic Muons}
\label{sec:lifetime}

The program used for the counting yields a data file in which the counts of each channel are saved. With the conversion function \ref{eqn:MCA} signal durations are calculated. The data 
is shown in figure \ref{fig:lifetime}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .8\textwidth]{fit.pdf}
    \caption{Data for the determination of the lifetime of cosmic muons. $N$ are the counts of muons and $t$ is time correspondend to the channel.}
    \label{fig:lifetime}
\end{figure}

The counts of the muon decays should follow an exponential law given by equation \ref{eqn:exp}. 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:exp}
    N(t) = N_0 \mathrm{e}^{-t/\tau} + U_0
\end{equation}

In this equation $N_0$ is the basis amount of muons, $\tau$ is the lifetime and $U_0$ is the constant background rate. $U_0$ was estimated in section \ref{sec:background}.
To extract the lifetime $\tau$ the exponential function given by equation \ref{eqn:exp} is fitted to the data in figure \ref{fig:lifetime}.
The fit yields the properties of the dataset. The values are:
\begin{align*}
    N_0 &= \num{18.9 +- 0.7}, & \tau &= \qty{1.62 +- 0.11}{\micro\second}, & U_0 &= \num{1.4 +- 0.2}
\end{align*}

The regression is also plotted in figure \ref{fig:lifetime}.
